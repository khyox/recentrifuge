"""Bio.SeqIO quick support for FASTQ files

You are expected to use this module via the Bio.SeqIO functions.
This module is for reading and writing FASTQ output files as SeqRecord
objects, but omitting some checks included in the Biopython method by Peter
Cock. These checks were very useful in the "olden times" but, currently,
with huge FASTQ files using standardized PHRED quality scores, they can be
omitted, which improves the code performance.
